# Flashcard Deck Manager

**lanki** is a Python-based and soon-to-be command-line application for practicing flashcards stored as CSV files. It uses spaced repetition (specifically the [Leitner verison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)) to improve memory retention and provides features to reset, edit, and practice flashcard decks.

It is desiged to be both effective for learning and super simple to use.

## How to use **lanki**: 
1. clone this repo
2. run main.py
3. (optional) add you're own deck in the ./decks folder using the same format as in exampledeck.csv
4. follow the instructions printed in termnial from main.py

> It's called lanki as in "lars's anki"! tihi
